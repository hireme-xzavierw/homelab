* Setup

Documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/install/docker/installation/

1. Created /srv/gitlab
2. Create docker compose file for gitlab
3. Use image gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
   1. Community edition (Free)
   2. Latest because i don't think I need the cutting edge 'nightly'
4. In the compose file hostname: refers to the internal hostname the container will use.
5. Set $GITLAB_HOME to /srv/gitlab
6. Note that software data and logs will be mounted in /var
   1. May be useful to know when migrating to kubernetes
7. Changing SSH port to avoid conflict. Using $GITLAB_PORT environment variable. Storing in .env
