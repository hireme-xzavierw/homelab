* Homelab Docs

This repo attempts to achieve two goals:
 - To bring GitOps principles to my homelab, enabling rapid redeployment.
 - To advertise the skills I posses which are not reflected in my job history.

 
* Roadmap for Employers

Please keep in mind that this project grows in real time and doesn't represent the full extent of my capabilites.
