* Homelab Docs

This repo documents my homelab in an attempt to achieve two goals.
 - To slowly bring IAC principles to my homelab so that in the event of a catastrophe it can be easily rebuilt.
 - To advertise skills that I have learned pursuing this project that aren't reflected in my job history

 
* Roadmap for Employers

The following roadmap explains where to go so see an example of my ability to host/implement/utilize specific technologies.
Please keep in mind that this project grows in real time and doesn't represent the full extent of my capabilites.
