* Synopsis

Step by step guide to launching openvpn.

* Procedure

1. Enter the command 'sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/server
   - For whatever reason starting openvpn as a service via systemd fails. I might be able to fix that by changing the way systemd calles openvpn OR
     configuring systemd to run a script that starts openvpn as a service.
   - the 'config' option specifies which config file will be used to start openvpn. In my case it is server.conf. The file extension can be safely left off.
2. You will be prompted by a password, enter the oen that corresponds to the CA certificate.
