* Query Notes

** Suricata eve.json

 - The "alert_ignature" Field contains information on what a triggered event is and why it is important or troubling. If you made a custom rule and you know what the log message is, you can use this field to confirm it.
 - "alert_Signature_ID" is the ID number for the triggering event. This is also searchable and can be used to identify specific events.

** General Query Tips
 - Count By (Filename) is not counting the file itself. It is counting the instances of log data that match you overall query within (filename)
 - The explore feature is the best place to start building a dashboard
