* Overview

The design of the homelab requires port-forwarding and the home network will suffer
an increased risk of intrusion as a result. Although steps to mitigate this risk (the specifics of
which are beyond the scope of this document) have been taken, the likelihood of suffering
an intrusion will never be zero. With this in mind I am designing a log management system for the purpose
of tracking events and alerting myself when they do happen.

* Requirements

To achieve these goals the system needs the following capabilities

** System Requirements [0%]
 - [ ] Consolidate logs from multiple machines on the network
 - [ ] Visualize logs for quick analysis
 - [ ] Set thresholds or triggers for certain events
 - [ ] Notify via email or text when thresholds are reached
 - [ ] Low cost
 - [ ] Relatively low maintenance

* Proposed Solution

The proposed solution leans of FOSS software to maintain low cost at the expense of a high upfront
labor requirement. Hopefully this labor requirement, which will naturally shrink after the initial setup
, can be further mitigated by automating maintenance tasks.

** Tools

These tools when taken in aggregate should provide what I need to reach the stated requirements

 - [ ] Grafana Alloy
   - For forwarding logs to Loki
 - [ ] Grafana Loki
   - For aggregating logs
 - [ ] Grafana
   - For visualization and alerts
